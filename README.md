# Apollo Automation M-1 Brackets

This repository contains stl files that can be used to physically connect multiple
Apollo Automation M-1 LED matrix panels together. The brackets are designed to fit
the mounting holes on the panels and provide a secure connection between them using
M3 screws between 8mm and 12mm in length.
